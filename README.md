# INFO ABOUT THIS PIECE

**This is my first website development project.**

Its made using basic-intermediate **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.
The main focus of this project was *functionality*, therefore the Graphic Design was kept more simple.

## Features

**Fully dynamic card and contact generation**: team members can be added and removed at will without any changes in the code.

**Newest video section**: videos are currently manually set, working on integrating the YouTube API to automatically display the latest videos.

## Notes

This example project was used for a Content-Creation Group, but the structure is general and can be adapted to any team or group.
